The thali is in the shape of India's map and they served condiments in tri-colour. Overall the food is enough to serve 3-4 people easily but I think two people with a good appetite might be able to finish it. Best part is that the tiffin contains mukke wala pyaaj. Overall a very nice concept and a must try experience."

Comprising of all things delicious like chilli potatoes, chilli paneer, manchurian, noodles, fried rice, and spring rolls, this gave us some major platter goals. My favourite from this platter has to be the chilli paneer, it was so soft and the flavours were bang on. Also, if this platter is too much for you, they even have a smaller portion available for INR 150 which includes all these delicacies but the quantity is comparatively less."
